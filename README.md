# Italy Greenhouse Gas Emissions Analysis (1990–2023)

This project examines long-term trends in Italy’s greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from 1990 to 2023 using official Eurostat data.

The final purpose was to identify the long-term emission trends and to find the top 3 largest annual reductions over the observed period.

## Data Source
Data were obtained from Eurostat: [Greenhouse gas emissions by source sector](https://doi.org/10.2908/ENV_AIR_GGE)
- Unit of measurement: *Thousand tonnes CO₂ equivalent*
- Sector selected: *Total greenhouse gas emissions*

## Methodology
Python(primarly Pandas and Matplotlib libraries) were applied to perform the analysis.
Two visualizations were produced:
- Total annual GHG emissions trend (1990–2023)
- Annual percentage change in emissions

## Key Fundings
Final results highlighted the following:
- Italy reduced total GHG emissions by 36.21% between 1990 and 2023
- The largest annual reductions occurred in: 2023(11.38%), 2013(11.15%), and 2009(10.88%).

While this project does not formally investigate causal relationships, major economic shocks such as the 2009 financial crisis and the 2013 economic instability likely contributed to the sharpest emission declines.

## Repository Content
- Python analysis script
- Database used for the analysis
- Two visualizations of emission trends and annual percentage changes
